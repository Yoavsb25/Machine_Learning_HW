## üìÇ Projects Overview

### **1. Linear Regression**
- Implemented a **linear regression** algorithm to predict house prices.  
- Leveraged **NumPy** for matrix operations and **pandas** for data manipulation.  
- Focused on understanding the math behind the regression model and error minimization.

### **2. Decision Trees**
- Developed a **decision tree classifier** in Python with the following features:  
  - **Entropy** and **Gini impurity** for split evaluation.  
  - **Gain ratio** for enhanced attribute selection.  
  - **Depth pruning** and **chi-squared pruning** for overfitting prevention.  
- Gained insights into tree-based learning models and their interpretability.

### **3. Classification Algorithms**
- Implemented various classification algorithms, including:  
  - **Naive Bayes**  
  - **Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)**  
  - **MaxPrior**  
  - **Maximum Likelihood (MaxLikelihood)**  
- Focused on probabilistic models for classification tasks.

### **4. Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes**
- Built a **logistic regression** model with **gradient descent** for binary classification.  
- Implemented **Naive Bayes** using the **Expectation-Maximization (EM)** algorithm for Gaussian mixture models.  
- Performed **feature selection** using **Pearson correlation** to optimize model accuracy.

### **5. K-Means Clustering**
- Implemented **K-Means** and **K-Means++** clustering algorithms.  
- Applied clustering techniques to **image color quantization**, reducing image colors while maintaining visual fidelity.  
- Explored concepts of initialization, convergence, and clustering performance.
